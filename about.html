                            <p>Growing up with my time split between my parents in Alabama and Florida, I think I got lucky in the sense
                                that my grandpa Ellis Champion - my partial eponym - probably encouraged me more mentally than physically
                                (it probably doesn't hurt that I was the baby of my generation, too). After being impressed with my performance in school
                                he would encourage me to continually grow and seek out knowledge after tossing a bit of money my way as a reward.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I like to think that getting a paycheck for what I do is the analogous sequence of events in adulthood, but this 
                                certainly set the stage for my work ethic and personal endeavors so far in life.</p>

                                I'm a software developer living in Huntsville, AL. Currently I'm working with Jacobs ISG and helping
                                automate government business practices, which I think is pretty rad. After graduating with a BS in Computer Science
                                from Auburn University, I stuck around for three years there working with Heartland Payment Systems designing
                                and maintaining online and desktop payment processing systems. Things began to change as I encroached
                                on a few life goals, so I decided to pick up and move to Huntsville to settle down for the forseeable future.</p>
