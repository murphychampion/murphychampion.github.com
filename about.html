                            </div>
                            <p>Growing up with my time split between my parents in Alabama and Florida, I think I got lucky in the sense
                                that my grandpa Ellis Champion - my partial eponym - probably encouraged me more mentally than physically
                                (it probably doesn't hurt that I was the baby of my generation, too). After being impressed with my performance in school
                                he would encourage me to continually grow and seek out knowledge after tossing a bit of money my way as a reward. I like to think that getting a paycheck for what I do is the analogous sequence of events in adulthood, but this 
                                certainly set the stage for my work ethic and personal endeavors so far in life.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I was always taught to pour everything I have into whatever I set my mind to, not only by my grandfather but
                                by both of my parents as well. I often had high expectations set for me by my family, especially after seeing
                                me pick up reading, math, and science skills so quickly and so early on. Grandpa Champ even thought I was so smart
                                that I'd go on to become a brain surgeon who would separate conjoined twins! I don't quite have the stomach for that.
                                It seems that as time went on, my family's expectations tempered from continually being met but I continued to set
                                sights higher.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>There were times as a kid that I was limited. Where I couldn't provide something materially, I was always sure to 
                                provide in information. There would be instances where I'd come up on a project where my peers would do their best
                                to make extravagant or eye-popping displays when I was left competing with a wealth of data, information, or knowledge.
                                I think it built a good foundation of researching, learning, and writing, which are all skills that I value and cherish today.
                                I love to read, and as I began to delve into computer science and software development I loved the process of reading about a
                                feature and then being able to bring it to life minutes later after getting hands-on with what I just read.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I think I can say I'm dedicated, but feel free to ask other people to be sure.
                                I'm a software developer living in Huntsville, AL. Currently I'm working with Jacobs ISG and helping
                                automate government business practices, which I think is pretty rad. After graduating with a BS in Computer Science
                                from Auburn University, I stuck around for three years there working with Heartland Payment Systems designing
                                and maintaining online and desktop payment processing systems. Things began to change as I encroached
                                on a few life goals, so I decided to pick up and move to Huntsville to settle down for the forseeable future.</p>

                            <p>I like to describe myself in summary in three words:</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>   
                    </br>

                            <u>Punctual</u>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I strive to be on time, whether it's for an appointment or finishing a piece of work in an allotted timeframe.
                                Punctuality was instilled in me as a very important concept from very early on in life. I view it as necessary 
                                to keep people happy, to meet goals, and to keep events relatively predictable. Even in fast-moving environments
                                where requirements may change regularly and things become somewhat spontaneous punctuality keeps me grounded and
                                focused on where I need to be and what needs to be done by when.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <u>Meticulous</u>
                            <br/>
                            <p>It's probably a good thing to be detail-oriented in a profession that relies on details. I try to create products
                                that are the best they can be before handing them off to the next person in line or showing them off to others. 
                                Sometimes I'm satisfied with things relatively quickly, while other times this results in many, many rounds of changes
                                before someone is able to look at a product of my work (don't look at the change history on this website, please). 
                                The desire to fine-tune things is in my nature. Aside from this, I tend to be nigh-obsessed with organization and routines.
                                I find that the wildest of projects or requirements can be effectively handled after they are structured into to-do lists
                                and run through a standard process.

                            <br/>
                            <p>So long as work is being done and is meeting expectations, there's no need for things to be serious all the time. I enjoy
                                making people laugh or smile, whether it's with me or at my expense (just not always at my expense - a person can only
                                handle so much embarrassment). I don't ever like distracting people from their work, but in their downtime I'd rather them
                                be happy than wound up or tense. Being goofy every now and again makes work a fun place to go and be, and not some mundane
                                room where we spend the majority of our lives.</p>

                            <p>Personally, I like spending time on a specific set of things and activities. I have quite a few special people in
                                my life, and one very special dog. Honestly though, all dogs are special.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy writing, although I don't seem to have enough time to do that as I once did. Playing outside with my dog
                                Koda is always fun, except in the summertime when it feels like you enter a preheated oven as you walk through any
                                door to the outside. I spend a lot of time playing video games. I'm a Nintendo guy, born and raised, but I do use 
                                my PlayStation from time to time. If you catch me playing anything there's a good chance it's either The Legend of Zelda
                                or Pok√©mon.</p>
